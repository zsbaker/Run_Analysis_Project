As part of Getting and Cleaning Data, this final project entails downloading accelerometer data collected from a number of galaxy smartphones. The dataset and explanation of the collection process available here: 
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).


## Run-analysis.R

As required for the assignment, after downloading the required files, the following R script will accomplish the following:

	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
